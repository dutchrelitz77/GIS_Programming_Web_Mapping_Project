				<p class="about">This website was created at Brigham Young University as a project requirement for the GIS Programming for Engineers class taught by Dr. Ames in the Civil Engineering department. The assignment was to create on online website showing GIS features. The site needed to be interactive, allowing users to explore each event through a map interface. It required that 16 events in the history of the LDS church be identified with geolocated spatial data sets and attribute information. At least one of these events had to represented by a polyline, one had to be represented with a polygon and the remaining events could be represented by points.</p> 
				<p class="about">We chose to focus on the history of the LDS church in Europe specifically. On the main page, the map, along with 15 points, one polyline and one polygon are displayed. The points show individual temples or MTCs across Europe. The polyline shows Orson Hyde's missionary journey and the polygon shows the extent of the LDS population in Europe. On the left side of the page, navigation buttons are provided so that the user can choose which events to zoom to and learn more about. The layers can also be toggled on and off with these buttons. By simply clicking on an individual event's icon, a popup box will appear on the screen that tells the user more information about the event and provides an image and a link for more information.</p> 
				<p class="about">Also provided on this site is a page for technical and end user documents. These documents are provided as a help tool for anyone interested in learning about how the site works, how it was coded, or how it can be navigated. Further questions about the website or project can be directed to the creators. We hope you enjoy the site and find it useful and informative.</p>
